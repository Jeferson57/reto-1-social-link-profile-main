## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Custom colors in Tailwind
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      "Green": "hsl(75, 94%, 57%)",
      "White": "hsl(0, 0%, 100%)",
      "Grey": "hsl(0, 0%, 20%)",
      "Dark-Grey": "hsl(0, 0%, 12%)",
      "Off-Black": "hsl(0, 0%, 8%)"
    },
  },
}
```

Styles class
```html
<h2 class="text-White text-2xl font-bold">
  Jessica Randall
</h2>
```


### Continued development

I would like learn more about JavaScript and focusing make interactive websites and thes learn Reat.js. But a lear some tricks with Tailwind like animation, dark mode, state...
